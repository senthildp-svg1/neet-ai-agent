CHAPTER 5: LAWS OF MOTION

5.1 Introduction
Aristotle's view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.

5.2 Newton's First Law of Motion
Everybody continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise.

5.3 Newton's Second Law of Motion
The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.
F = ma, where F is the net external force on the body, m is its mass and a is its acceleration.

5.4 Newton's Third Law of Motion
To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction.
When a body A exerts a force on body B, body B exerts an equal and opposite force on body A.

5.5 Conservation of Momentum
The sum of momentum of the two bodies does not change during collision provided there is no external force acting.
m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2

5.6 Friction
Friction is the force which opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. The force of static friction is a self-adjusting force up to the limiting friction, fs ≤ μsN, where μs is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force.
